A game for finnish game jam 2018.

Devs Roskis & Telac.

To play:

1) clone the project (You need git LFS) and start it up with unity.
2) that's it

(You'll probably need to assign some of the assets manually, as git sometimes seems to remove references of those assets to public script variables on its own...)
